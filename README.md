# Intel Image Classification Live Demo
This repository is created in order to launch a live demo of my [Intel Image Classification Hackathon](https://github.com/luangtatipsy/intel-image-classification) model. This pre-trained model classifies a scene image at a time into the following categories: buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, street.
